LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell vga_sync_unit/conteo[0]__0_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) conteo_reg[0]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[10]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[11]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[12]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[13]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[14]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[15]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[16]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[17]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[18]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[19]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[1]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[20]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[21]__0/CLR, conteo_reg[22]__0/CLR (the first 15 of 32 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell vga_sync_unit/conteo[0]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) conteo_reg[0]/CLR, conteo_reg[10]/CLR, conteo_reg[11]/CLR, conteo_reg[12]/CLR, conteo_reg[13]/CLR, conteo_reg[14]/CLR, conteo_reg[15]/CLR, conteo_reg[16]/CLR, conteo_reg[17]/CLR, conteo_reg[18]/CLR, conteo_reg[19]/CLR, conteo_reg[1]/CLR, conteo_reg[20]/CLR, conteo_reg[21]/CLR, conteo_reg[22]/CLR (the first 15 of 32 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_gen_clk_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_gen_clk_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_gen_clk_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_gen_clk_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>
