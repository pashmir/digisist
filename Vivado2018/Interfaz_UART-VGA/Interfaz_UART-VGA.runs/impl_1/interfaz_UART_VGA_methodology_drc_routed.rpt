TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock VGA/clock_unit/gen_clk_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin VGA/clock_unit/gen_clk_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
